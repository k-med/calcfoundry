View Source How to Interpret Your Results Understanding Body Mass Index The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a screening method used by healthcare providers to identify potential weight problems. While it is not a perfect diagnostic tool (it does not account for muscle mass or bone density), it is the global standard for initial health assessment.\nStandard Categories (WHO) Underweight: BMI less than 18.5 Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9 Obese: BMI of 30 or greater A Note on Muscle Mass Athletes and bodybuilders may have a high BMI because muscle weighs more than fat. In these cases, a high BMI does not necessarily indicate poor health.\nThe Math Behind It BMI is calculated differently depending on your unit system, though the underlying ratio remains the same:\n$$ BMI_{metric} = \\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{\\text{height (m)}^2} \\qquad \\text{vs} \\qquad BMI_{imperial} = 703 \\times \\frac{\\text{weight (lbs)}}{\\text{height (in)}^2} $$\nWhere:\nWeight: Measured in kilograms (kg) or pounds (lbs).

History Clear History This calculation runs locally in your browser. View Source How to Use This Calculator The Eighth Wonder of the World Compound interest is often jokingly referred to as the \u0026ldquo;eighth wonder of the world\u0026rdquo; because of its ability to turn small, consistent efforts into massive results over time. Unlike Simple Interest (where you only earn money on your principal), Compound Interest means you earn interest on your interest.\nHow it Works The Snowball Effect: In the beginning, growth looks flat. This is the \u0026ldquo;accumulation phase.\u0026rdquo; The Inflection Point: Once your interest payments exceed your contributions, your wealth begins to grow vertically.

This calculator adjusts your purchasing power based on this input. The Math Behind It We calculate your future balance using the standard compound interest formula, but the \u0026ldquo;Purchasing Power\u0026rdquo; calculation adjusts for inflation using the Real Rate of Return (Fisher Equation):\n$$ r_{real} = \\frac{1 + r_{nominal}}{1 + i_{inflation}} - 1 $$\nWhere:\n$r_{real}$ is the Inflation-Adjusted Return Rate. $r_{nominal}$ is your expected investment return. $i_{inflation}$ is the expected annual inflation rate.

View Source How to Interpret the Split The Tale of Two Inflations This calculator allows you to see the difference between the Official CPI (Consumer Price Index) reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the ShadowStats Alternative CPI.\nWhy the difference? In 1980 and again in 1990, the US government changed how it calculates inflation. Critics, most notably John Williams of ShadowStats, argue these changes were political moves designed to lower reported inflation (and thus lower Social Security COLA payments).\nThe Two Main \u0026ldquo;Gimmicks\u0026rdquo; Removed by ShadowStats: Substitution Bias: The government assumes that if steak gets expensive, you switch to hamburger, so your \u0026ldquo;cost of living\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t go up. ShadowStats argues this lowers your standard of living. Hedonics: If a computer costs the same but gets faster, the government counts that as a price drop. ShadowStats argues you still paid the same amount of cash. By removing these adjustments and using the original 1980 Methodology, ShadowStats typically shows inflation running 4% to 8% higher than official reports.\nThe Math Behind It The tool calculates two different future values ($FV$) based on different Consumer Price Indices (CPI):\n$$ FV = P \\times \\frac{CPI_{End}}{CPI_{Start}} \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad FV_{Shadow} = P \\times \\frac{CPI_{End} \\cdot (1+d)^n}{CPI_{Start}} $$\nWhere:\n$FV$ is the Future Value (Cost in Target Year). $P$ is the Principal (Amount in Start Year). $d$ is the Divergence Factor (The difference in methodology). $n$ is the number of years the divergence has compounded.
